* TODO youtube 
  1. [X] Define a struct with the video info
  2. [X] In the submodule showpage of youtube.rkt, there is an error
     when video-info-from-page is called. It seems it happens when
     there is a video for which not all the information is available
     on the page. So, not all the defined functions to extract
     infomation work properly. Fix it.
  3. [X] Get video id's of all videos in a certain page
  4. [X] Function that loops over all the obtained id's, gets the video
     info for each and transforms it to the video info struct.
  5. [X] Write a html template that receives a list of video info
     struct and shows the picture, title, duration and username
  6. [ ] Write documentation.
